# Automated License Plate Recognition System

## Overview

This repository contains an Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system designed to detect and recognize license plates from video streams. The system uses computer vision and optical character recognition techniques to automatically identify license plates and extract their text.

## Value Proposition

An automated license plate recognition system improves traffic flow, reduces congestion, and eliminates the need for manual toll collection. This modern machine learning-based system can accurately and efficiently recognize license plates from various states at high speeds, day and night, under different weather conditions.

## Features

- Real-time license plate detection from video streams
- Optical character recognition (OCR) for plate text extraction
- REST API for integration with other systems
- Batch processing capabilities
- Performance metrics and evaluation tools
- Docker support for easy deployment

## System Architecture

The system consists of several modular components:

1. **Video Processing**: Handles video streaming and frame extraction
2. **Detection**: Identifies license plates in images
3. **Text Recognition**: Extracts text from detected license plates
4. **API Service**: Provides RESTful endpoints for system integration
5. **Metrics and Evaluation**: Tools for model performance assessment
